# ResNet50-with-PyTorch
This is an application of the ResNet architecture in PyTorch, where I build the different blocks that compose the ResNet to then test it with a Kaggle's dataset.

* The content of the notebook is inspired in the coursework in **Convolutional Neural Networks - Week 2**, from [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). I utilized the knowledge adquired during the lessons and took inspiration from the code developed during the coursework to implement a **ResNet** and test it with **Dogs vs. cats Competition Dataset**.

* The training of the CNN was not commited in depth, it is just a light application to test my understanding and capability of coding something functional, hence the relative short performance
